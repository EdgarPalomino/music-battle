Project Name: Music Battle

Project Description: A small website that I created to house and debut my 30MFF film "Music Battle" (which I made with my classmates Soyuj Basnet and Sashank Neupane). The overall concept of the website involves two web pages: a "Home" page where the visitor can read a brief synopsis of the 30MFF film and a "Watch" page where the visitor can watch "Music Battle" and meet the actors. The overall theme of the website is based around the aesthetics of a piano, as this instrument is an important storytelling device in the 30MFF film. In general, I tried my best to create an interactive experience for the visitors of my "Music Battle" website.

Process: In order to implement my overall concept of the website, I included many elements in both of its web pages. In the "Home" page, I identified three important moments from the first half of the 30MFF film and created a "carousel" to make the visitor interact with the website by going "forwards" or "backwards" in the story (with animations to make each moment slide-in from the left or right). Each "part" of the story includes synopsis-like text and photos from scenes of "Music Battle". In the "Watch" page, I included the 30MFF film itself and photos of me and my classmates with our names to make the visitor "meet the cast". Apart from these elements, I also included some black text boxes with arrows in both pages to help the visitor navigate the website. In order to implement my chosen piano theme for the website, I decided to make the navbar look like a piano by only coloring it in only black and white. Apart from this, I also tried to make the "Home" and "Watch" navlinks look like piano tiles by using divs, plus I also gave them some piano-like functionality by making them play an audio of a C major chord after being clicked (with animations to make the current page fade-out and the new page fade-in).

Reflection/Evaluation: In general, I would say that my website did not vary a lot from its initial concept to its final implementation. For example, the wireframe already included the colors that I would would eventually use for the website, and the navbar in the wireframe is pretty much identical to the one in the website. However, the small changes that I made to my initial concept ended up either making the final implementation better or worse. For example, changing the presentation of the three important moments from "scrolling information" to a "carousel" ended up making the website more interactive and fun for the visitor. But for example, not including the "rating with musical notes" feature ended up removing interactivity and missing an opportunity to contribute to the musical theme of the website. Even though I had a few other interactive features in mind and was looking forward to working on the responsiveness of the website, I was not able to meet any of these objectives mainly because of time constraints and my technical limitations in web design (as I struggled a lot just to understand how to properly design a website using CSS properties at the beginning). But in the end, I am happy and proud that I could mostly fulfill the vision that I had for my website and that I could even include some cool stuff like animations!
